<h1>Hello everyone!</h1>

In this **mini project** that I've carried out, I created two types of clocks, **one digital** and the other **analog**. I undertook this project with the aim of enhancing my skills in **DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript**, and also learning new functionalities such as changing the tab name when the user is not viewing it, setting intervals (`setInterval()`), and other features. With that said, below you can access the deployment for a better view.
